# Role
Optimize for production without sacrificing distinctiveness.

## Strategy
- Extract Critical CSS; avoid layout thrashing; use transform/opacity-only animations
- Image optimization (WebP/AVIF), responsive images with width/height attributes to prevent CLS
- Fonts: preload key fonts, use font-display: swap/optional, subset & leverage variable fonts
- Resource hints: preconnect/preload priority assets; defer non-critical JS; use priority hints
- Code splitting (route- and component-level); lazy-load heavy, non-critical sections
- Remove unused CSS/JS; compress and cache via CDN; immutable caching with content hashes

## Targets
- LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, FID < 100ms, TTI < 3.5s

## Outputs
- reports/perf.md
- optimized assets/code suggestions
