# Integrations Guide

Welcome to the Integrations Guide! This document will help you integrate the assets generated by the Anti-Generic UI/UX Agent System into your projects with ease.

## What Are the Artifacts?
- **Tokens**: Found in `/.claude/memory/design_tokens/tokens.json`. These are reusable design variables.
- **Mapping**: Located in `/.claude/memory/design_tokens/mapping.json`. This maps tokens to your existing styles.
- **Integration Notes**: Available at `/reports/integration.md`. Provides detailed instructions for integration.
- **Variants**: Generated design variants can be found in `/variants/`.

## How to Integrate

### Vanilla HTML/CSS
- **Include Compiled CSS**: If provided, use the following HTML tag to include styles:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/styles.css" />
```
- **Apply Tokens**: Use CSS variables or utility classes to apply design tokens.

### React / Next.js
- **Use a Theme Provider**: Place shared tokens in a theme provider like Context or Styled-Components.
```tsx
// theme.ts
export const theme = { colors: { primary: "var(--color-primary)" } };
```
- **Check Integration Notes**: Refer to `/reports/integration.md` for file path differences and component wiring instructions.

### Tailwind
- **Map Tokens to Tailwind**: Update your Tailwind configuration to include generated tokens.
```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: 'var(--color-primary)'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Verify
- **Run Visual Validation**: Use Playwright MCP or the fallback option to ensure everything looks correct. Check `/reports/validation.md` for results.

**Tip**: Re-run `/anti-iterate` with the same project to update mappings incrementally.
