# Roadmap — What’s Next?

This roadmap shows what’s coming soon and what’s planned for the future. We keep things simple so everyone can follow along.

## Coming Soon (Near-term)
- **Better Uniqueness Scoring**: Smarter ways to check if designs are truly unique (looks + meaning).
- **Visual Diffs for Each Component**: Easier to compare design changes for every variant.
- **More Framework Templates**: Support for Nuxt, Solid, Qwik, and more.
- **Stronger Accessibility Checks**: Better rules for navigation, focus, alt text, and color contrast.

## Next Steps (Mid-term)
- **Live Preview Server**: See changes instantly with a “hot-iterate” loop.
- **Persona-based Microcopy**: Generate text that matches different user types and tones.
- **A/B/n Experiment Tools**: Run and measure experiments with built-in analytics.

## Future Ideas (Long-term)
- **Export to Design Systems**: Convert between Figma tokens and code tokens easily.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Handle multiple locales with translation checks.
- **Pluggable Validators**: Add more validators like Lighthouse MCP and Axe MCP.

We update this roadmap often. Your feedback helps shape what comes next!
